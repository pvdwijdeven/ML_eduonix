# From the mtcars data set, define the model matrices for a linear 
# regression model of 𝑚𝑝𝑔 = 𝑤𝑡 + ℎ𝑝. Calculate the 𝛽 vector.




# Validate that 𝛽^𝑇 𝑋^𝑇 𝑦 and 𝑦^𝑇 𝑋𝛽 evaluate to the same scalar.




# Validate that 𝜕𝐿/𝜕𝛽 |_(𝛽_0, 𝛽_1,…,𝛽_𝑘 )=−2𝑋^𝑇 𝑦+2𝑋^𝑇 𝑋𝛽=0.



# What are the dimensions of the resulting vector? Why does this make sense?




#   Fit the model using the 𝑙𝑚() function. 



# Plot actuals and predicted values, as well as the residuals. 
# Comment on the distribution of the residuals.



# Calculate SSE and RMSE and offer interpretations for each.



# Recall the RMSE for the model 𝑚𝑝𝑔 = 𝑤𝑡 was about 2.95. 
# What does this tell you about using ℎ𝑝 as a predictor for 𝑚𝑝𝑔?
